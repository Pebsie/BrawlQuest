quest|item|Ogre Head;5|Recovery;1;EXP;100|The only part of this town that still stands is myself and the church I swore to protect. Do you know what scares Ogres enough to stop them from bashing down your door? Ogre brains smeared on the door pane. I'm too old and frail to slay these ogres myself but... would you care to help a kindly old man who just wants to keep the last bastion of his town alive?|3|You're a saint.
