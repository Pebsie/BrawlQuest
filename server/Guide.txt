updateFights(dt)
  This gets its own section because I need to explain a bit more about its behaviour.
  We cycle through all fights.
  Mobs are broken down and assigned into the "mob" array.
  Mobs then move towards their target at the speed set in data/mobs
  If their target isn't a static point then their target x and y is updated to the player they've got targeted

=UI=
When the player takes damage they'll receive a message for feedback in the UI, formatted as follows:
  dmg,dmga,x,y - Means you've dealt dmga to the mob at x,y
  tdmg,dmg - Means you've taken dmg damage. Make sure these messages all add up to the current amount before displaying.
