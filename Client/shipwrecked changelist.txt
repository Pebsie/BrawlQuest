  [b]Elaborations & Notes[/b]

[h1]Revamped armour system[/h1]
There's something really satisfying about grinding away and [i]finally[/i] finishing your current tier armour set in other MMORPGs. BrawlQuest is designed around simplicity and at first it seemed like having one piece of armour per set would be perfect to fit this design ethos.

However, as past Alpha events showed it feels somewhat anti-climactic to finish difficult content and get [i]the[/i] armour piece for this tier of content. It also means that most encounters can be completed once and are then considered "done" with no reason to redo that boss, and as a result you miss out on the ability to try out new strategies or there's no tangible reward in running lower powered guildies through this content.

The new armour system (and subsequent character spriting changes) creates three parts to every armour tier: head, chest and legs. You can also [i]finally[/i] see your equipped weapon on your player. This will allow us to create special costumes in the future which enables opportunities for roleplaying, and means that we can change what the character beneath the armour looks like without having to redo every image for that character.

[h1]New music and sound effects[/h1]
Something that makes any game world come to life is the music and sound effects. I find it vital to creating an atmosphere and when I think back to past projects my greatest memory is the mixture of sound effects and music.

My good friend Joey Pearce (YouTube: JoeyFunWithMusic) has agreed to compose the music to BrawlQuest and I've spent a few walks trying to take some original and natural sound effects to try and give this game that atmospheric feeling.

The engine now allows for tiles to have their own ambient sounds when they're visible on your screen and the music is now set to trigger as you encounter different things rather than cycle randomly. The old music is removed for this Alpha to really give the Lost Island a different feel to past events.

[h1]Revamped looting system[/h1]
Once a fight is complete your earned loot is now displayed in a line allowing you to manually walk over it to pick it up. This feels a lot nicer and means that you can identify what loot you've earned without having to sit through the pop up window.

[h1]Added minimap[/h1]
The minimap will be worked on and updated throughout the course of Shipwrecked. It currently shows a tiny representation of what you've currently uncovered in the map with a crosshair that shows your current location. Hopefully this will make navigation a little bit easier!

[h1]Added encounter scoring system[/h1]
Your score is equal to the damage that you cause multiplied by your kill combo and then divided by your ATK. This last division is done so that your highscore isn't just defined by your current power level.


New Fights:
* Spiders (Level 1)
* Crabs (Level 2)
* Ghostly Knight (Late game)
* Cannibals (Late game)
* Cannibal Hut
* Dungeon: Demon
* Dungeon: Knight
* Raid: King of the Old World

Bugs:
* Minimap crosshair is inaccurate when in anything other than default window width and height
